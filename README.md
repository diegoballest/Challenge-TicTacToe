# Challenge-Connect4

Implementation of a great Connect-4 AI player using alpha-beta pruning (minimax) algorithm.

It is not unbeatable because the current heuristic is based on the max depth, so it stops any losing positions, however it doesn't avoid wasting turns where it can't win. √çt's good enough though.
