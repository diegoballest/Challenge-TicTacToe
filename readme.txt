This is a connect4 implementation, coded by Diego Alfredo Ballesteros Bautista, Moisés Montaño and Martin Molinero
like a project for TC2011 Intelligent Systems.
This connect4 implementation uses minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning to obtain the best possible move for an
AI player.

In order to run this project, navigate to the directory where it is located. Make sure you have python3 installed.
In case python3 is not already installed, it is needed to run the following commands in terminal in order to install it on ubuntu.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
After installing python3 the challenge can be executed without problems.
Navigate to the directory where it is located and execute
$ python3 connect4.py
This is going to execute our connect4 implementation

After AI player makes the first move, the user can decide in which column he wants to make the next move.

This game process continues until we have a tie or a winner.
